# Continuous-Bit-Toggling-using-Code-Composer-Studio
This project is developed using Code Composer Studio (CCS) v12. The main objective of this project is to continuously toggle all the bits of Port 1 (P1) using the MSP430AFE223 microcontroller from the MSP430 family, which is pin-compatible with the 8051 microcontroller family.
